# Make Day core values

## 1. Learn with intentional play

  Make Days are not specifically goal-oriented or team-oriented. We provide a structured environment for you to explore a sphere in tech, and it's surrounding tools. You can use the day to learn a lot about one particular aspect, get familiar with a number of components, or build something complex with starter components that we provide. Most importantly, have fun.

  _Varied approaches include:_
  A. dive deep: spend the whole day on one activity
    e.g. learn a language you've never used before, like Google Go, by using an SDK to move the sphero around on your desk and change it's color. Then use Go's event channels to do (something more?)


  B. wide and shallow: work on a couple of small activities to get an understanding of how several concepts fit together
    e.g. use Javascript, a language you're familiar with, (then?)

  C. aim at a big goal, utilising preconfigured components
    e.g. connect Sphero to AWS IoT and send messages over the internet (? 3 activities)

  D. something completely different


## 2. Learn from eachother

  It's good to learn together, so you'll start off the day in small groups. That doesn't mean you have to spend the entire day in lock-step with your team. Some teams want to tackle one big thing together for the whole day. Some teams choose to (achieve one goal) together, then later split into other teams and work on something else. Some teams join forces half-way through the day to multiply their efforts. There are many paths to interact with others on this course and no rules; feel free to be flexible.


## 3. Get always-on guidance from experts
  
  Sometimes you'll want to struggle, sometimes you'll want to fast forward. Whether you need a nudge or a life raft, Make Masters are <always on Slack> and will be at the Make Space to help you on the day. You also have access to a wealth of resources for each activity, ranging from barebones starter kits to full working demos.

## 4. Come prepared

  Those that prepare more, get more out of the day. It also helps to set your intentions before the day.
